        <p>I am currently attending the George Washington University coding boot camp in Arlington, VA. I am relatively new to coding, and I am taking the course to enter into the IT field.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Roanoke College with a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations in 2018. I have lived in Roanoke, Virginia; Wilmington, Delaware; and Alexandria, Virginia.</p>
        <p>In addition to learning to be a full-stack developer, I speak fluent German, and my goal is to work as a developer in a German-speaking country.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy running and traveling. I ran cross country and track and field in high school and college, and I recently traveled to Austria to visit relatives.</p>
